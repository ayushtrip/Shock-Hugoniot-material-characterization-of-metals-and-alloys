Charactrestics described by Hugoniot relation: Equation of state, Phase transition, Material strength (Shock compressibility) under extreme conditions Passing of a shock wave
Refer to the presentation PDF for all the plots of Aluminium and Tungsten Heavy Alloy
Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulato(LAMMPS) code was developed to simulate impact loading of materials to obtain shock hugoniot Equation of state for the material
